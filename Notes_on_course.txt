Provision development environment
 => Company uses AWS cloud provider
Use case: Provision base configuration:
    - AWS us-east-1 region
        - VPC within this region
            - single Subnet-1 in VPC
                - singel EC2 instance inside this subnet, which is running Nginx as a web Server
                - create routing resources
                - create security group to allow web traffic

HCL Syntax:
    Object Types
        1) Providers
            define info about plugin of provider you use
        2) Resources
            - things, you want to create in a target environment. E.g. an EC2 instance
            - each resources is associated with a provider
        3) Data Sources
            - a way to query information from a provider
            - simply asking about information (not creating anything)
            - each resources is associated with a provider

    Configuration Block Syntax 
        block_type "label" "name_label" {
            key = "value"
            nested_block {
                key = "value"
            }
        }

        exemplary resource block:

        resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
            name = "web-server"
            ebs_volume {
                size = 40
            }
        }
         => TF object reference: 
                aws_instance.web_server.name
